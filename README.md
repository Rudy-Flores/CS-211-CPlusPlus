Summarize the project and what problem it was solving

In this project I was tasked with creating a clock system that would display two different clocks showings the time in two formats. One was in standard form and the other was military time. The clocks had to be displayed simultamiously and it shoudl have the ability to add either 1 sec, 1 min, or 1 hr. The requirements for the stadnard format of time were it must not go over 12 for hours and 60 for mins and sec. Similarly for military time, it should not go over 23 for hours and 60 for mins and sec.

What did you do particularly well?

I feel like I did very well creating the functions that the program would use and the programming the logic of the program itself

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would transfer the functions into a seperate class file instead of it being in the main.cpp, I would also implement a function to get the system time so it can adjust to any computer. 

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
 Yes making this program work with two different clocks was challengeing. At first only one clock was working and the other one would not do anything correctly. I did alot of trouble shooting inorder to make both work with each other correctly.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The main skill I learn from this project is the usefullness of pointers.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Most of the program is written in functions so finding logic erors is easy, there are plenty of comments so figureing out what a certrain function or piece of code does is easy to figure out.
